Preparation for EX447 exam.

I haven't taken the exam (yet) or the DO447 class, this is purely based on my predictions of what the exam could be and the exam objectives:)
Parts inside the Ansible folder are grouped by objectives (missing part 1, since that's the git part and missing all Tower tasks). Part 0 is just random stuff I wanted to practice.
